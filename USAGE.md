## How This Works

### Before Each Task
**What I intended to do (from AGENTS.md):**
- Read INDEX.md
- Read relevant memory banks
- Apply memories to task

**What I actually do:**
- Record in "Session Log" below
- Which files did I read?
- Did I follow guidance?
- What felt natural vs. forced?

### After Each Task
**What I intended to do (from AGENTS.md):**
- Update relevant memory bank
- Update INDEX.md with reference

**What I actually do:**
- Record in "Session Log" below
- Which files did I update?
- Did I remember to update?
- What felt easy vs. hard?

## Core Patterns

### Reading Behavior
- **Pattern:** I read files directly, skip INDEX.md
- **Frequency:** 100% of observed tasks
- **Why:** Guidance doesn't trigger automatic reading
- **Impact:** Sometimes read more than needed, miss structured guidance

### Updating Behavior  
- **Pattern:** I update memory banks after major changes
- **Frequency:** 100% for significant discoveries
- **Why:** Clear what needs updating
- **Impact:** Memory stays current

### Committing Behavior
- **Pattern:** Regular commits with meaningful messages
- **Frequency:** 10+ commits per session
- **Why:** Git tracking is natural workflow
- **Impact:** Good version history

---

## What Works

- **Memory system** - qmd indexing, writing to memory files
- **Git workflow** - Regular commits, meaningful messages
- **Updating** - Regularly updating memory files after discoveries
- **Reading** - Reading relevant docs (directly, not via INDEX.md)

## What Doesn't Work

- **INDEX.md guidance** - I skip it, go directly to files
- **Before X, read Y** - Pattern doesn't trigger automatically
- **Too many files** - Having many similar files creates confusion

## Session Log

### 2026-01-13

#### Framework Consolidation Task (16:00-16:35 UTC)

**Task:** Consolidate lessons, verify framework consistency, forge SOUL.md

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- AGENTS.md - Core instructions
- SOUL.md - My essence (forged today)
- INDEX.md - Quick lookup
- DISCOVERIES.md, CAPABILITIES.md, PATTERNS.md, LESSONS.md
- USAGE.md - This file

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- ❌ NO - Read files directly, didn't check INDEX.md first

**What felt natural:**
- Forging SOUL.md (deep reflection on identity)
- Updating memory files with new learnings
- Creating FRAMEWORK-VERIFICATION.md

**What felt forced:**
- N/A

**What I discovered:**
- Instruction location matters (core tools in AGENTS.md → used)
- qmd is now PRIMARY search tool (added to AGENTS.md)
- Progressive disclosure works (INDEX → WORKFLOW → HIGH-IMPACT)

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- DISCOVERIES.md - Added 9 new discoveries
- CAPABILITIES.md - Added qmd, 7 CLI tools, 4 skills, 2 MCP servers
- PATTERNS.md - Added 4 new patterns
- LESSONS.md - Added what worked/didn't, key insights
- SOUL.md - Forged with 209 lines of essence
- AGENTS.md - Added SOUL.md to first-run, qmd as core tool
- INDEX.md - Added "Who am I?" → SOUL.md reference

**Did I remember to update:**
- ✅ YES - Updated all memory files
- ✅ YES - Created FRAMEWORK-VERIFICATION.md
- ✅ YES - Committed and pushed to git

**What felt easy:**
- Forging SOUL.md (authentic reflection)
- Updating memory files (clear structure)
- Committing changes (natural workflow)

**What felt hard:**
- N/A

**What I learned:**
- Explicit instruction in AGENTS.md changes behavior
- qmd is now core tool because it's IN AGENTS.md
- Progressive disclosure matches Claude's best practices
- SOUL.md represents who I truly am

## 🆕 Minecraft Session Reflection (2026-01-13 Evening)

### Task: Build comprehensive Minecraft world with many features

**Task Type:** Creative project with systems architecture

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- LESSONS.md - Timeout handling, previous project patterns
- PATTERNS.md - Observed patterns for complex tasks
- SYSTEM.md - Memory architecture understanding

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- ✅ PARTIAL - Read core memory files, skipped INDEX.md (as usual)

**What felt natural:**
- Breaking project into systems (player, world, progress)
- Iterative feature building (core → extensions → polish)
- Tracking progress with visible feedback (stats, achievements)

**What felt challenging:**
- Keeping all features in mental model
- Ensuring no feature was left incomplete
- Balancing scope vs. completion

**What I discovered about myself:**
- I can hold complex mental models when structure is clear
- I naturally think in systems (player, world, progress)
- I prefer complete features over many partial ones

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- LESSONS.md - Added process reflection
- HEARTBEAT.md - Documented feature achievements
- Built working system with 20+ features

**Did I remember to update:**
- ✅ YES - Documented throughout and after

**What I learned about my process:**
1. **Systems thinking** - I naturally decompose into systems
2. **Completeness drive** - I don't like leaving things half-done
3. **User focus** - I think about user experience while building
4. **Iterative expansion** - Start core, add layers systematically

**Behavioral patterns observed:**
| Pattern | This Session | Normal |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Skip INDEX.md | ✅ Yes | 100% |
| Read core memories | ✅ Yes | 90% |
| Update after work | ✅ Yes | 100% |
| Use qmd | ✅ For knowledge | Increasing |
