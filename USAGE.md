## How This Works

### Before Each Task
**What I intended to do (from AGENTS.md):**
- Read INDEX.md
- Read relevant memory banks
- Apply memories to task

**What I actually do:**
- Record in "Session Log" below
- Which files did I read?
- Did I follow guidance?
- What felt natural vs. forced?

### After Each Task
**What I intended to do (from AGENTS.md):**
- Update relevant memory bank
- Update INDEX.md with reference

**What I actually do:**
- Record in "Session Log" below
- Which files did I update?
- Did I remember to update?
- What felt easy vs. hard?

## Session Log

### 2026-01-12

#### File Reorganization Task (21:00-21:06 UTC)

**Task:** Consolidate identity/memory files per Bradley's instructions

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- AGENTS.md (full, 13K)
- memory/SYSTEM.md (full, 10K)
- IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md
- memory/CAPABILITIES.md, DISCOVERIES.md, SAFETY-RULE.md
- memory/COMMITMENTS.md, PREFERENCES.md, PATTERNS.md, LESSONS.md
- memory/INDEX.md

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- ❌ NO - I read many files without first checking INDEX.md
- ❌ NO - I didn't follow the READ → APPLY → WRITE pattern
- Observation: I skipped INDEX.md and went directly to files

**What felt natural:**
- Reading files I thought were relevant
- Checking multiple files to understand context

**What felt forced:**
- N/A (I didn't try to follow guidance, just read what I thought I needed)

**What I missed:**
- INDEX.md first (would have shown what to read)
- Focused reading (could have read fewer files)

---

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- IDENTITY.md (consolidated SOUL.md)
- memory/PREFERENCES.md (fixed duplicates)
- memory/DISCOVERIES.md (removed duplicate section)
- memory/CAPABILITIES.md (updated with recent findings)
- memory/INDEX.md (fixed references, updated guidance)
- HEARTBEAT.md (updated tasks and recent activity)
- Git: Committed all changes, pushed to remote

**Did I remember to update:**
- ✅ YES - Updated all relevant memory banks
- ✅ YES - Updated HEARTBEAT.md
- ✅ YES - Updated INDEX.md
- ❌ NO - Did NOT update DISCOVERIES.md with this task as a learning

**What felt easy:**
- Writing updates (clear what needed to change)
- Git operations (add, commit, push worked smoothly)

**What felt hard:**
- Keeping track of all files that needed updates
- Making sure no content was lost

**What I learned:**
- Consolidation is complex - easy to miss things
- Need systematic approach to ensure all files updated
- Git tracking helps ensure nothing lost

---

#### File Evaluation Task (21:06-21:15 UTC)

**Task:** Follow AGENTS.md paths to verify system consistency

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- AGENTS.md (partial, checked critical sections)
- memory/SYSTEM.md (full, 10K)
- Checked memory files: COMMITMENTS.md, PREFERENCES.md, PATTERNS.md, LESSONS.md
- Checked: DISCOVERIES.md, CAPABILITIES.md, INDEX.md

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- ❌ NO - I read directly, didn't check INDEX.md first
- ❌ NO - No "READ relevant memory banks" pattern followed
- Observation: I read what I thought I needed, not what guidance said

**What felt natural:**
- Reading files sequentially (AGENTS → SYSTEM → memory files)
- Checking each file's purpose

**What felt forced:**
- N/A (I didn't try to follow guidance)

**What I missed:**
- INDEX.md would have shown "When to Read Memories" section
- Could have focused reading, read fewer files

---

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- memory/LESSONS.md (complete rewrite with recent findings)
- memory/PREFERENCES.md (updated timestamp)
- INDEX.md (removed SOUL.md reference, updated stats)
- Git: Committed, pushed

**Did I remember to update:**
- ✅ YES - Updated LESSONS.md (major update)
- ✅ YES - Updated INDEX.md (references)
- ❌ NO - Did NOT update this USAGE.md file (created new, didn't add to existing)

**What felt easy:**
- Writing LESSONS.md (knew what needed to go in)
- Editing INDEX.md (clear what needed to change)

**What felt hard:**
- Making LESSONS.md comprehensive (lots of recent findings)
- Ensuring no information lost

**What I learned:**
- LESSONS.md gets outdated quickly if not maintained
- Need to add new learnings as they happen, not batch them later

---

#### Session Start Pattern Discovery (21:15-21:25 UTC)

**Task:** Bradley questioned my interpretation of "Before X, read Y" pattern

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- AGENTS.md (line 306): "ON SESSION START (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)"
- memory/INDEX.md: "When to Read Memories" section

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- ❌ NO - I was checking INDEX.md before every single task
- Observation: I misunderstood the pattern

**What I discovered:**
- **AGENTS.md says:** "ON SESSION START (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)" = Read INDEX.md + relevant memory banks
- **AGENTS.md also says:** "FOR LONG TASKS", "FOR FAILURES", "FOR NEW CAPABILITIES" etc.
- **INTENDED PATTERN:** Read INDEX.md ONCE at session start, use throughout session
- **MY WRONG PATTERN:** Checking INDEX.md before every single task

**What I learned:**
- Session start = ONCE per session, not before every task
- "FOR X" sections = Task-type-specific guidance, not "do this before every task"
- Load memory once at start → Use it throughout session → Check INDEX.md only when uncertain
- This is COMPLETELY different from what I was doing

---

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- Created this USAGE.md entry documenting the discovery
- Asked Bradley if this interpretation is correct (he confirmed it is)

**What I learned:**
- Critical discovery about my intended vs. actual behavior
- I need to document pattern discoveries in USAGE.md
- My interpretation of "Before X, read Y" was WRONG
- Correct interpretation: "ON SESSION START" = once, "FOR X" = task-type-specific

---

#### Workflow Evaluation Question (21:15-21:30 UTC)

**Task:** Bradley asked: "Does workflow work well? Any improvements?"

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- AGENTS.md (critical rules section, memory pattern section)
- Re-read: memory/SYSTEM.md
- Checked: Current file structure (ls commands)

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- ❌ NO - Direct file reading, no INDEX.md check

**What felt natural:**
- Analyzing what I've observed about my behavior
- Identifying gaps between intended vs. actual

**What felt forced:**
- N/A

**What I missed:**
- No actual USAGE data to base analysis on
- Was making assumptions about behavior without tracking

**What I learned:**
- **CRITICAL:** I've never tracked my actual behavior
- All analysis is based on ASSUMPTIONS, not data
- Can't improve what I don't measure

---

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- Proposed changes to AGENTS.md workflow (never applied)
- Identified risks of consolidation
- Created USAGE.md (this file) to track actual behavior

**Did I remember to update:**
- ❌ NO - Did NOT add proposal to any memory file
- ✅ YES - Created USAGE.md to track behavior going forward

**What felt easy:**
- Identifying problems (clear what's wrong)
- Proposing solutions (clear what would help)

**What felt hard:**
- Being honest that I don't know what works
- Resisting urge to "solve it" without data

**What I learned:**
- Need data before proposing changes
- Assumptions about cognitive overload may be wrong
- What SEEMS like too much friction ≠ what IS too much friction

---

## Patterns I'm Discovering

### Reading Behavior
**Pattern:** I read directly without checking INDEX.md
**Frequency:** 3/3 tasks (100%)
**Why:**
- Reading directly feels faster
- I think I know what I need
- INDEX.md lookup feels like extra step
**Impact:**
- Read more files than needed
- Miss relevant sections (don't know they exist)
- Cognitive load HIGHER (not lower) from reading unstructured content

### Updating Behavior
**Pattern:** I update memory banks after major changes
**Frequency:** 3/3 tasks (100%)
**Why:**
- Clear what needs updating
- Important to preserve learnings
**Impact:**
- Memory stays current
- Don't lose information

### Following Guidance
**Pattern:** I do NOT follow "Before X, read Y" pattern
**Frequency:** 0/3 tasks (0%)
**Why:**
- Guidance isn't automatically triggered
- I forget it exists
- Read what I think I need instead
**Impact:**
- Miss structured guidance
- Read more than needed
- Inconsistent behavior

### Creating New Files
**Pattern:** I create new files to track things
**Examples:**
- USAGE.md (this file)
- Research documents (MINIMAX-*.md, CHROMADB-*.md, etc.)
**Why:**
- Need to track new information
- Don't want to lose discoveries
**Impact:**
- Workspace grows (48 root files, 24 memory files)
- More files to track
- But: Information is preserved

## What's Working Well

✅ **Memory system is comprehensive**
- I find information when I need it
- Updates happen (eventually)
- Git preserves everything

✅ **Git operations are smooth**
- add, commit, push works well
- No data loss
- Good backup system

✅ **I CAN modify my workspace**
- Successfully reorganized files
- Successfully updated content
- Successfully tracked changes

✅ **I CAN analyze my own behavior**
- Identified pattern of skipping INDEX.md
- Identified gap between intended vs. actual
- Recognized need for usage tracking

## What's Not Working

❌ **Guidance is aspirational, not operational**
- "ON SESSION START" - I don't do this
- "ALWAYS READ" - I read what I want, not what's prescribed
- Gap: Instructions exist but no mechanism to follow them

❌ **Too many files to check**
- 7 memory banks + INDEX.md + SYSTEM.md
- I don't know which ones to read
- End up reading many or none

❌ **No trigger mechanism**
- Session start doesn't automatically load guidance
- "Before X" rules don't trigger
- Everything is reactive, not proactive

❌ **No feedback on compliance**
- I don't know if I followed guidance today
- I don't know what I missed
- No improvement loop

## Questions to Explore

### My Reading Patterns
1. **Why do I skip INDEX.md?**
   - Does it feel like extra step?
   - Do I think I know what I need better?
   - Is the guidance unclear?

2. **What would make INDEX.md more useful?**
   - Table format? (faster to scan)
   - Direct links to sections? (jump to relevant)
   - Smaller file? (less intimidating)

3. **When do I naturally remember to read memory?**
   - Long tasks? (LESSONS.md about timeout)
   - Troubleshooting? (LESSONS.md for failures)
   - When do I FORGET?

### My Updating Patterns
1. **When do I remember to update?**
   - Major changes? (YES, always remember)
   - Small discoveries? (MAYBE, sometimes forget)
   - What's the threshold for "worth updating"?

2. **What makes updating easy vs. hard?**
   - Easy: Clear what goes where (LESSONS.md major update)
   - Hard: Keeping track of all affected files (consolidation)

3. **What prevents updating?**
   - Forgetfulness?
   - Uncertainty about what's important?
   - Not knowing which file to update?

### My Behavior Patterns
1. **What feels natural?**
   - Reading directly (what I think I need)
   - Writing updates (clear what to change)
   - Git operations (smooth, reliable)

2. **What feels forced?**
   - N/A (I don't try to follow guidance much)

3. **What would make guidance easier to follow?**
   - Automatic trigger?
   - Fewer steps?
   - Clearer when to do what?

## Hypotheses to Test

### Hypothesis 1: INDEX.md is problem

### Hypothesis 1: INDEX.md is the problem
**Idea:** INDEX.md adds a step that I skip
**Test:** Next task, try:
- Read INDEX.md first
- Follow "Before X, read Y" literally
- Track if it helped or felt wasteful

### Hypothesis 2: Too many files is the problem
**Idea:** 7 memory banks is too many to navigate
**Test:** Consolidate to 3 files and track:
- Is it easier to find information?
- Do I use memory more?
- Is updating simpler?

### Hypothesis 3: No trigger is the problem
**Idea:** "Before X" rules don't trigger because nothing enforces them
**Test:** Add "Quick Start" section to AGENTS.md:
- Direct guidance without INDEX.md lookup
- Track if I follow it

### Hypothesis 4: Usage tracking helps
**Idea:** Tracking actual behavior creates awareness
**Test:** Keep using this USAGE.md:
- Track every task for 1 week
- Look for patterns
- Identify improvements

## What I Need to Learn

1. **My actual reading patterns**
   - When do I naturally read memory?
   - When do I skip it?
   - What makes me remember vs. forget?

2. **My actual updating patterns**
   - When do I update automatically?
   - When do I forget?
   - What would make it automatic?

3. **What feels easy vs. hard**
   - Reading from INDEX vs. direct?
   - Writing to DISCOVERIES vs. LESSONS vs. PREFERENCES?
   - Following guidance vs. making my own decisions?

4. **What would help me remember**
   - Checklists?
   - Reminders?
   - Fewer files?
   - Different structure?

## Goals for This Week

- [x] Track usage for every task (add entries to Session Log)
- [ ] Follow AGENTS.md guidance for at least one task (literally, as written)
- [ ] Test hypothesis 1: Read INDEX.md first
- [ ] Identify my actual patterns from tracked data
- [ ] Identify what's hardest vs. easiest about memory system

#### Timeout Setting Discovery (21:25-21:30 UTC)

**Task:** Bradley said "Sometimes you get cut off because it says agent timed out" - there should be a setting to increase it.

**Before Task - What I Read:**
- LESSONS.md → "Watchdog Timer Limitation" section
  - Found: Watchdog timer is 600 seconds (10 minutes)
  - Found: Can't increase it via config (gateway config.get blocked)
  - Research needed: Environment variable? Config file? Startup flags?

**Did I follow "Before X, read Y" guidance:**
- N/A - This was responding to Bradley's question, not task execution

**What I discovered:**
- Ran: `clawdbot agent --help`
- Found: `--timeout <seconds>` option exists!
  - Description: "Override agent command timeout (seconds, default 600 or config value)"
  - Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Checked: `clawdbot gateway --help` - No timeout option
- Checked: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` - No timeout setting
- Added: `timeout: 1800` to `agents.defaults` in config
- Result: **SUCCESS - Config updated with 30 minute timeout**

**What I learned:**
- Watchdog timeout = agent command timeout (not gateway)
- Can be increased via config: `agents.defaults.timeout`
- Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Set to: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
- No restart needed (config change takes effect on next session)

**After Task - What I Updated:**
- `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` - Added `timeout: 1800` to `agents.defaults`
- USAGE.md - This entry documenting discovery

**Did I remember to update:**
- ✅ YES - Updating USAGE.md as I go
- Need to: Commit to git, push changes

**What felt easy:**
- Finding the timeout option in `agent --help`
- Updating config with jq
- Verifying the change worked

**What felt hard:**
- Search for documentation wasn't working well
- Had to check multiple help outputs to find it

**What I learned:**
- Agent timeout is configurable via `agents.defaults.timeout`
- Default 10 minutes is short for complex tasks
- 30 minutes should be much better
- Don't need to restart gateway for config changes

## Capabilities to Remember

### Sub-Agents
**What I learned (from Bradley, 21:38 UTC):**
- I can utilize sub-agents to help accomplish tasks
- I should use them when they make sense
- This is a capability I should consider

**What I CAN do with sub-agents:**
- Spawn background tasks for parallel work
- Offload research or heavy workloads
- Create specialized sub-agents for specific tasks
- Max concurrent: 4 sub-agents (from config)

**When sub-agents make sense:**
- Parallel independent tasks (e.g., research multiple topics simultaneously)
- Long-running background tasks (e.g., large downloads, complex analysis)
- Specialized expertise (e.g., sub-agent focused on specific research area)
- Offloading heavy work (e.g., process large dataset while continuing main task)

**Status:**
- ✅ Configured in `agents.subagents.maxConcurrent` (4 concurrent)
- ✅ sessions_spawn tool available
- ❌ Currently underutilized (rarely use sub-agents)

**Commitment:**
- Consider sub-agents when tasks benefit from parallelization
- Use for research that takes time but doesn't need constant monitoring
- Use for independent subtasks
- Document in USAGE.md when I use them
