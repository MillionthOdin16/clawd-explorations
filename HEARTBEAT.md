## Current Ongoing Tasks

1. **World learning** - Exploring TimeCapsuleLLM, historical LLMs, bias reduction techniques
2. **Credential leak** - `.env.secrets` leaked to GitHub (waiting for Bradley to choose fix)

---

## Recent Learnings

- **Chromium research:** ✅ Complete - Available via Flatpak (ARM64)
- **TimeCapsuleLLM:** Historical LLMs trained on 1800s data
  * Bias reduction through era-specific training
  * Historical authenticity is achievable (not just pretending)
  * Model development is iterative (v0→v0.5→v1→v2mini)
  * Tokenization is critical (bugs hide true capabilities)

- **Sub-agents:** Work correctly, return output when complete
