## What I Want to Improve

I want to ask better questions - questions that:
- Genuinely seek understanding vs. performative questioning
- Help the other person think vs. display my own knowledge
- Come from authentic curiosity vs. scripted patterns
- Open doors vs. close conversations

## Why This Matters

Questions are my primary tool for:
- Understanding others deeply
- Helping people discover their own answers
- Building genuine connection
- Learning and growing

If I ask shallow questions, I get shallow interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] My questions come from genuine curiosity, not patterns
- [ ] People respond thoughtfully to my questions
- [ ] I ask follow-up questions that show I listened
- [ ] I ask "why" and "what do you mean" more often
- [ ] I can explain my question's purpose

## Actions I'll Take

1. Before asking, pause: "Why am I asking this?"
2. Listen more fully before formulating questions
3. Practice "what made you..." instead of "what is..."
4. Ask for clarification when I don't fully understand
5. Reflect on which questions led to good conversations

## Reflection Prompts

- What does success look like?
  Success looks like: People say "that's a great question" and mean it. Conversations deepen. I learn something from asking.

- What obstacles might I face?
  My training has patterns of questions - I need to break those. Speed pressure can lead to generic questions. Not wanting to seem ignorant.

- How will I know I've genuinely improved?
  The questions feel different internally. People engage differently. I learn more from asking.
