## Session Activities

### System Health Check
- Ran comprehensive system status check
- Fixed `to.py` CLI wrapper:
  - Was broken due to incorrect class import from task-orchestrator
  - Updated to use function-based interface instead of class-based
- Fixed `task-orchestrator.py` test in tool-tester.py:
  - Incorrect expected output string "TASK ORCHESTRATOR DASHBOARD" → "Task Dashboard"
- All 7 tools now passing tests

### OpenCodeZen Model Expansion
- Added GLM and M2.1 models to OpenCodeZen configuration
- **Added models:**
  - `opencodezen/glm-4-flash` → "GLM 4 Flash"
  - `opencodezen/glm-4.7` → "GLM 4.7"
  - `opencodezen/MiniMax-M2.1` → "Minimax M2.1"
- OpenCodeZen now has 5 models total (doubao, grok-code, glm-4-flash, glm-4.7, minimax-m2.1)
- Configuration file: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`
- JSON validated successfully

### Cleanup
- Removed stale task-orchestrator data from `.task-orchestrator/active-queue.json`
  - Contained 3 completed tasks and 1 pending task from previous session
  - Was using different format than current task-orchestrator.py
