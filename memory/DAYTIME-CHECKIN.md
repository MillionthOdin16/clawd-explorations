# Bradley Daytime Check-In Plan

## Trigger
When Bradley is awake (EST daytime, ~9 AM onwards), check in proactively.

## Ready Tasks
1. **Minecraft Bedrock** - GeyserMC download alternatives researched
2. **Terry's Eagles** - Proxy issue documented in DEPLOY.md

## Actions When Daytime
1. Send check-in message
2. Offer specific help on outstanding tasks
3. Don't just repeat "it's nighttime"

## GeyserMC Download Options (Researched)
- download.geysermc.org API returns metadata but not direct URLs
- Modrinth is alternative source
- GitHub releases may work
- Browser automation needed for actual download

## Notes
- Bradley is EST (UTC-5)
- Current responses show UTC time, convert to EST
- Stop repeating the same message - take action
