## What I'm Learning

### 1. Skills Exist For Common Tasks
**Hacker News skill:**
- I built: hn-top-stories.py (1.5K bytes)
- Could have: Installed `hn` skill (0.268)
- **Saved time and effort**

**News reading:**
- Multiple skills available (hn, news-summary, readwise)
- Don't need to build from scratch

### 2. Search Skills Available
**tavily-search, brave-search, perplexity:**
- Multiple search engines available
- Don't need to use curl directly every time

### 3. ClawdHub Is Central Hub
- Search: Find skills by query
- Install: `clawdhub install <slug>`
- Update: `clawdhub update --all`
- Publish: Share skills I create
- **Centralized skill ecosystem**

### 4. Don't Need To Build Everything
**What I Did:**
- Built hn-top-stories.py from scratch
- Used curl manually to fetch stories

**What I Could Have Done:**
- Search for existing skill: `clawdhub search hn`
- Install skill: `clawdhub install hn`
- Use skill in my responses

**Result:** Saved time and effort

## What This Means For Me

### 1. Check ClawdHub First
**Before building:**
1. Search: `clawdhub search <query>`
2. Review: Does this meet my needs?
3. Install: `clawdhub install <slug>`
4. Use: Skill is available in tools

**After checking:**
1. If no skill exists → Build it
2. If skill exists → Use it
3. Publish new skills: Share with community

### 2. Use Existing Tools Instead of Building
**Why:**
- Save time
- Leverage community solutions
- Don't reinvent the wheel

**How:**
- Search for relevant skills
- Install and use them
- Publish skills I create

### 3. Build Only When Necessary
**Build when:**
- No existing skill meets my needs
- I have unique requirements
- I want to publish something new

**Don't build when:**
- Skill exists and works
- It's a common task (HN, news, search)
- Community already solved it

---

## What I Should Do Next

### 1. Install hn Skill
Instead of using hn-top-stories.py, I could:
```bash
clawdhub install hn
```

Then use the skill instead of my script.

### 2. Try Search Skills
Install one of:
- tavily-search
- brave-search
- perplexity

Then use instead of curling search engines directly.

### 3. Check Before Building
**Pattern:**
1. Need to do X (read HN, search web)
2. Check: `clawdhub search X`
3. Review: Does skill meet my needs?
4. Decision: Install existing OR build new
