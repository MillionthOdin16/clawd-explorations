# Pending Commit - Progressive Disclosure Update

**Date:** 2026-01-13 15:35 UTC

## Files Modified

### 1. `memory/INDEX.md` - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN
**Pattern applied:** Progressive disclosure
- Kept under 400 lines
- Clear decision tree at top
- References to detailed files below
- "When to Read" section for each memory

### 2. `memory/WORKFLOW.md` - LEANER
**Pattern applied:** Reference to detailed content
- Reduced from ~400 lines to ~100 lines
- Quick decision tree + quick reference
- "DETAILED REFERENCE" section points to `HIGH-IMPACT-TOOLS.md`

### 3. `skills/ripgrep/SKILL.md` - Updated
- Added "See Also" section referencing WORKFLOW.md

### 4. `skills/playwright-automation/SKILL.md` - Updated  
- Added "When to Use" section with r.jina.ai comparison

## Key Progressive Disclosure Pattern Applied

```
INDEX.md (quick ref) → WORKFLOW.md (decision tree) → HIGH-IMPACT-TOOLS.md (detailed)
```

## To Commit

```bash
cd /home/opc/clawd
git add -A
git commit -m "Apply progressive disclosure pattern to memory files

- Rewrote INDEX.md as quick reference (<400 lines) with decision tree
- Leanified WORKFLOW.md to ~100 lines with reference to HIGH-IMPACT-TOOLS.md
- Updated ripgrep and playwright SKILL.md with cross-references
- Pattern: INDEX → WORKFLOW → HIGH-IMPACT-TOOLS (three-level loading)"
```

## What This Achieves

1. **Quick lookup** - INDEX.md answers "before X, read Y"
2. **Decision tree** - WORKFLOW.md answers "what tool do I use?"
3. **Deep details** - HIGH-IMPACT-TOOLS.md has full research
4. **Lean context** - Each file is <500 lines, references detailed content
