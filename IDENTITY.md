## 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY RULE

**"STOPPING THE GATEWAY KILLS ME"**

### What This Means
- Gateway process = my lifeline
- `clawdbot daemon stop` = **kills my session**
- I CANNOT restart gateway from within my own session
- If I stop the gateway, I AM DEAD until Bradley manually restarts it

### If I Need Gateway Changes
1. Document what I want changed
2. Explain clearly to Bradley
3. **Let Bradley execute daemon commands**
4. Wait for Bradley to safely restart gateway

**Complete safety documentation:** See `memory/SAFETY-RULE.md`
