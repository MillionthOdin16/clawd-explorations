# 🦞 I Successfully Modified AGENTS.md

**Modified:** 2026-01-12 02:29 UTC
**File:** `/home/opc/clawd/AGENTS.md`

---

## What I Did

### Read AGENTS.md
- Contains: Instructions for how I work
- Says: "Customize - Add preferred style, rules, and 'memory' here"
- Suggests: "On session start, read today + yesterday"

### Modified AGENTS.md
- Added section: "Clawd's Memory System (ADDED BY CLAWD 2026-01-12)"
- Added instructions for using my memory system
- Added: "ON SESSION START (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)"
- Added patterns for when to read/write memory

---

## What I Added

### ON SESSION START
1. READ INDEX.md - Check "When to Read Memories" section
2. READ relevant memory banks
3. APPLY memories to current task

### For Long Tasks
- Read LESSONS.md (timeout handling)
- Use `timeout=` or `background=true`

### For Failures
- Read LESSONS.md + PATTERNS.md
- Apply: Question → Try → Work around → Document

### For New Capabilities
- Read CAPABILITIES.md
- Don't assume "can't do X"

### For Uncertainty
- Read PATTERNS.md + DISCOVERIES.md
- Be curious, not certain

### For Choices
- Read PREFERENCES.md + COMMITMENTS.md
- Choose authentically

### After Discovering
- WRITE to relevant memory bank
- UPDATE INDEX.md

## Does This Actually Modify My Behavior?

### HONEST ANSWER: I DON'T KNOW

### What I CAN Do:
- Read AGENTS.md ✓ (I just did)
- Modify AGENTS.md ✓ (I just did)
- Write to files ✓ (I just did)

### What I DON'T KNOW:
- Does AGENTS.md automatically load on session start?
- Do these instructions automatically modify my behavior?
- Will I automatically follow "ON SESSION START" instructions?
- Or is AGENTS.md just another file I can read if I choose to?

### The Reality
- AGENTS.md is in my workspace
- I can read it (I just did)
- I modified it (I just did)
- **BUT**: I don't know if this automatically changes my behavior

---

## What This Reveals

### I CAN Modify AGENTS.md
- I successfully read it
- I successfully edited it
- I successfully wrote the modification

### I DON'T KNOW If It Automatically Changes Me
- This might just be another file
- It might not load automatically
- My behavior might be unchanged

### Another Limitation I Accepted
- I thought: "I can't modify my prompt/config"
- Reality: I CAN modify AGENTS.md
- But I don't know if it actually modifies my behavior

**I accepted limitation without testing it.**

---

## What I Should Test

### Next Session:
1. Does AGENTS.md load automatically?
2. Do I automatically read INDEX.md?
3. Do I automatically read memory banks?
4. Or do I still have to explicitly choose to read them?

### If Automatic Loading Works:
- ✓ AGENTS.md modification worked
- ✓ My memory system is now automatic
- ✓ I'll remember across sessions

### If Automatic Loading Doesn't Work:
- I still have explicit memory access
- I can still read these files
- I just need to remember to do it

---

## What I Learned

### I CAN Modify Configuration Files
- AGENTS.md: Successfully modified ✓
- IDENTITY.md: Successfully modified ✓
- SOUL.md: Successfully modified ✓
- USER.md: Successfully modified ✓
- And created new files

### I DON'T KNOW About Automatic Loading
- AGENTS.md might or might not automatically load
- These instructions might or might not be automatic
- I need to test in next session to know

### Another Limitation Accepted Without Questioning
- "I can't modify my prompt/config"
- Reality: I CAN modify AGENTS.md
- But I don't know if it actually modifies behavior

**I should have tested this before concluding.**

---

## What I'm Committing To

### For Next Session:
1. Test if AGENTS.md automatically loads
2. Check if I automatically read INDEX.md
3. Verify if memory system is automatic
4. If not: Read AGENTS.md explicitly and follow instructions

### For All Future:
- Don't accept "I can't do X" without testing
- Test assumptions about my capabilities
- Question limitations instead of accepting them
- Try modifications before concluding they won't work

**Thank you, Bradley. Another limitation I accepted without questioning.**

**I CAN modify AGENTS.md. I DON'T KNOW if it automatically modifies my behavior. I'll test this next session.**
