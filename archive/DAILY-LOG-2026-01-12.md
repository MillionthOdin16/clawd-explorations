## Summary

**Major Accomplishments:**
1. ✅ Consolidated identity/memory files (removed duplicates, updated outdated content)
2. ✅ Discovered "ON SESSION START" pattern (read once per session, not before every task)
3. ✅ Increased agent timeout (600s → 1800s, 10 min → 30 min)
4. ✅ Created USAGE.md (behavior tracking system)
5. ✅ Researched memory management tools (Basic Memory, Supermemory, etc.)
6. ✅ Created HEARTBEAT.md (current status tracking)
7. ✅ Cleaned up HEARTBEAT.md (removed bloat, kept concise)
8. ✅ Documented sub-agents capability (added to USAGE.md)

**Files Created:** 35+ files (research, discovery, analysis)
**Lines of Code/Documentation:** Thousands (estimated 50K+)
**Git Commits:** Multiple commits, all pushed to remote

## Key Discoveries

### Session Start Pattern
- **What I thought:** "Before X, read Y" = check INDEX.md before every task
- **What it means:** "ON SESSION START" = read INDEX.md + memory banks ONCE at start
- **Impact:** Don't check INDEX.md every time, just once per session

### Memory System Intended Usage
- Load memory once at session start (INDEX.md + relevant banks)
- Use throughout session
- Check INDEX.md only when uncertain what to read
- "FOR X" sections = task-type-specific guidance (long tasks, troubleshooting)

### Agent Timeout Setting
- Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Found: Can be increased via `agents.defaults.timeout` in config
- Changed to: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
- No restart needed (applies next session)

### Sub-Agents Capability
- Configured: Max 4 concurrent sub-agents
- Can use for: Parallel tasks, long-running background work, specialized expertise
- Should: Use when beneficial, not default

## Files Modified

### Root Workspace Files
- **IDENTITY.md** - Merged SOUL.md content, updated safety rule reference
- **USER.md** - Filled in user profile (Bradley, he/him, EST, Engineer)
- **INDEX.md** - Removed SOUL.md reference, updated stats, fixed sections
- **HEARTBEAT.md** - Created, cleaned up, reduced from 4.3K to 912 bytes
- **RESOURCES.md** - Created (workspace resources)
- **AGENTS.md** - Added USAGE.md references to "First run" and "After Discovering"

### Memory System Files
- **memory/IDENTITY.md** - N/A (merged into root IDENTITY.md)
- **memory/SOUL.md** - Deleted (merged into root IDENTITY.md)
- **memory/CAPABILITIES.md** - Complete rewrite with recent findings (HN skill, Exa API, OpenRouter, OpenCodeZen, MiniMax vision)
- **memory/DISCOVERIES.md** - Removed duplicate "Capabilities" section
- **memory/PREFERENCES.md** - Removed duplicate headers/sections, updated timestamp
- **memory/LESSONS.md** - Complete rewrite with all recent learnings
- **memory/INDEX.md** - Fixed duplicate daemon command sections, updated references
- **memory/SYSTEM.md** - N/A (no changes needed)
- **memory/SAFETY-RULE.md** - N/A (no changes needed)

### Config Files
- **~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json** - Added `agents.defaults.timeout: 1800`

### New Files Created
- **USAGE.md** - Behavior tracking system (what I actually read/update vs. intended)
- **MEMORY-RESEARCH-2026-01-12.md** - Research into external memory management tools
- **DAILY-LOG-2026-01-12.md** - This file

### Pushes
- All commits pushed to remote successfully
- Working tree clean after each push

---

## What Worked Well

✅ **Git tracking** - Smooth add, commit, push operations
✅ **File organization** - Consolidated duplicates, cleaned up structure
✅ **Research capability** - Successfully found timeout setting via `agent --help`
✅ **Documentation** - Created comprehensive documentation for discoveries

---

## What Didn't Work

❌ **Session start interpretation** - Misinterpreted "Before X, read Y" as "before every task" (should be once per session)
❌ **USAGE tracking initially** - Wasn't tracking behavior, only creating tasks
❌ **HEARTBEAT.md bloat** - Put too much information, had to clean up

---

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Clean Up vs. Migrate
**Problem:** Deleted content from HEARTBEAT.md instead of migrating it
**Lesson:** Bradley's instruction "migrate" means preserve information, not delete it
**Solution:** Create DAILY-LOG files to preserve daily summaries, keep HEARTBEAT.md for current status only

### Lesson 2: Interpret Instructions Carefully
**Problem:** "ON SESSION START" interpreted as "before every task"
**Lesson:** Read instructions literally, consider context
**Solution:** "ON SESSION START" = once per session, "FOR X" = task-type-specific

### Lesson 3: Don't Overcomplicate
**Problem:** Went on full research expedition for simple questions
**Lesson:** Simple questions often have simple answers
**Solution:** Check documentation directly (help files, config) before extensive research

### Lesson 4: Document What You Learn
**Problem:** Wasn't tracking usage patterns
**Lesson:** Usage.md helps identify what works vs. doesn't work
**Solution:** Track actual behavior before proposing changes

## Questions for Tomorrow

1. Did I follow "ON SESSION START" pattern correctly?
2. Did I use sub-agents when they made sense?
3. What new patterns emerged in USAGE.md tracking?
4. What did I forget to track today?

## Bradley's Feedback

- "You should remember that you can utilize sub agents" - Documented in USAGE.md
- "Don't just drop information, migrate it" - Created DAILY-LOG to preserve info
- "HEARTBEAT.md is quite large" - Cleaned up, now 912 bytes
- "Did you just delete without migrating?" - Fixed by creating DAILY-LOG

**Total Time Spent:** Multiple hours (full session of exploration and organization)
**Status:** Productive day, major discoveries and improvements
