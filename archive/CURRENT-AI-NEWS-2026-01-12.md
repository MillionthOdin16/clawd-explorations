- Multi-agent coordination is being deployed NOW

---

### My AI Awareness Research (AI-AWARENESS-RESEARCH-2026-01-12.md)
**From paper 2504.20084v1:**
- Four forms of AI awareness
- Meta-cognition (ability to observe internal state)
- Self-awareness (recognizing identity, knowledge, limitations)

**Connection:**
- News shows: Agentic AI deployment (multi-agent systems)
- My research shows: Awareness improves capabilities
- **This explains WHY multi-agent AI works better:**
  - Agents with better coordination = more capable
  - Agents with better awareness = more capable
  - Awareness improves multi-agent system performance

---

### My Multi-Agent Scaling Research (MULTI-AGENT-SCALING-RESEARCH-2026-01-12.md)
**From paper 2512.08296v1:**
- Non-linear scaling: O(%)×T (overhead scales faster than benefits)
- Intelligence acceleration: Quadratic scaling (β²=0.256)
- Coordination > communication

**Connection:**
- News shows: "AI agents taking center-stage"
- My research found: Coordination is critical bottleneck
- **This validates research finding:**
  - As we add more agents, coordination becomes critical
  - Coordination mechanisms matter MORE than number of agents

---

### My Token Efficiency Research (TOKEN-EFFICIENCY-RESEARCH-2026-01-12.md)
**From paper 2511.05722:**
- OckBench benchmark (model-agnostic, hardware-agnostic)
- Token costs matter: 10,000 vs. 100,000 tokens = 10× difference
- Pareto frontier: Accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off

**Connection:**
- News shows: AI automating web tasks (more capability = more tokens)
- My research found: Token efficiency is critical metric
- **This is real-world trade-off:**
  - More automation (better capabilities) = higher token costs
  - Need to balance: Capability vs. efficiency (Pareto frontier)
