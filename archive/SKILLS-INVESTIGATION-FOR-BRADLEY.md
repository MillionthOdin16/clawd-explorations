- Bradley values efficiency

**Benefits:**
- Daily tasks automatic
- No manual intervention
- Saved time

---

### 4. Documentation/Organization Skills
**Why:**
- "Clean and consolidate things"
- "Make easier to consume information"
- "Better documentation for you + it's up to you"

**Benefits:**
- Easier to find information
- Better organization
- Saved time

## What I Recommend

### For Bradley (Engineer working with AI/ML):

**MOST USEFUL: Install sag (Sag) skill**
```bash
clawdhub install sag
```
**Why:**
- Bradley specifically asked about "vector database"
- Sag provides: Document processing, embeddings, semantic search, RAG
- Essential for: AI/ML work, knowledge retrieval
- Perfect fit for: Engineer working with AI/ML

**ALSO USEFUL:**
- Research online for: ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus (open-source vector databases)
- Consider: Local vector database vs. cloud (Pinecone)
- Ask Bradley: What type of vector database? (Open-source vs. cloud)

### For Me (Better Memory):
- **Useful:** r2-upload (share files with Bradley)
- **Less Useful:** remind-me (just reminders)

**NOT RECOMMENDED:**
- Complex memory plugins (might not integrate well)
- External memory systems (might not work with my memory/ folder)
